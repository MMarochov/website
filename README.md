# Personal Website (the responsive version)
This is my personal website, made with Svelte.

## Dev notes
- Think about doing named slots so all input text is in app.svelte
- Mouse Message
- CV download / view

## Deployment

To deploy, run the following commands in the terminal:
- ```npm run build```
- ```npm run deploy```
